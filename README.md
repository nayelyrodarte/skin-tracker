A skin care routine calendar I made as a final project for the Centraal Academy's (@ Mexico City) bootcamp.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Add an .env file to the root folder with the **_private variables_** \* containing your server's port number of preferance and the MONGODB uri of your cluster.
4. Run `npm start`

`PORT=*Your port number goes here. Ex. 3000`
`MONGODB=*Your MONGODB uri goes here.*`
# For dev environment

5. Skip step 4 and run `npm dev` instead to get the server started with Nodemon.
5. Run `npm webpack` to run the client. 
6. If changes on styling are needed, run `npm sass` and start editing on the `styles.scss` file.
