# skin-tracker ðŸ’„

A skin care routine calendar I made as a final project for the Centraal Academy's (@ Mexico City) bootcamp.

Install
Fork or clone this repository.
Run npm install on your terminal.
You'll need to have basic knowledge of MONGODB and a newly-created cluster for this project.
Server and MONGODB set-up
Add an .env file to the root folder with private variables containing your server's port number of preference and a MONGODB uri to your previously created cluster. I called PORT and MONGODB to mine, as declaring them in uppercase is a convention for private variables.
Example:

PORT = 8000 MONGODB = _Insert your MONGODB uri._

Run npm start on your terminal.
