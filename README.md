A skin care routine calendar I made as a final project for the Centraal Academy's (@ Mexico City) bootcamp.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`

### Using MONGO-DB

1. You'll need a MONGODB account and a newly-created cluster for this project.
2. Add an .env file to the root folder with the **_private variables_** \* containing your server's port number of preferance and the MONGODB uri of your cluster.

- Remember to declare them in uppercase, as convention indicates.

Example:

`PORT = 8000`
`MONGODB = *Insert your MONGODB uri.*`

2. Run `npm start`.
