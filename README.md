# skin-tracker ðŸ’„
A skin care routine calendar I made as a final project for the Centraal Academy's (@ Mexico City) bootcamp. 

### Install
1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Run npm install on your terminal.
3. You'll need to have basic knowledge of MONGODB and a newly-created cluster for this project. 

### Server and MONGODB set-up
1. Add an .env file to the root folder with private variables containing your server's port number of preference and a MONGODB uri to your previously created cluster. 
I like to call PORT and MONGODB to mine, as declaring them in uppercase is a convention for private variables. 

Example:

PORT = 8000;
MONGODB = your MONGODB uri. 

2. Run npm start on your terminal.
